    <p>This is my December <br>
      This is my time of the year <br>
      This is my December <br>
      This is all so clear <br>
      This is my December <br>
      This is my snow covered home <br>
      This is my December <br>
      This is me alone <br>
      And I <br>
      Just wish that I didn't feel <br>
      Like there was something I missed <br>
      And I <br>
      Take back all the things I said <br>
      To make you feel like that <br>
      And I <br>
      Just wish that I didn't feel <br>
      Like there was something I missed <br>
      And I <br>
      Take back all the things that I said to you <br>
      And I give it all away <br>
      Just to have somewhere to go to <br>
      Give it all away <br>
      To have someone to come home to <br>
      This is my December <br>
      These are my snow covered dreams <br>
      This is me pretending <br>
      This is all I need <br>
      And I <br>
      Just wish that I didn't feel <br>
      Like there was something I missed <br>
      And I <br>
      Take back all the things I said <br>
      To make you feel like that <br>
      And I <br>
      Just wish that I didn't feel <br>
      Like there was something I missed <br>
      And I <br>
      Take back all the things I said to you <br>
      And I give it all away <br>
      Just to have somewhere to go to <br>
      Give it all away <br>
      To have someone to come home to <br>
      This is my December <br>
      This is my time of the year <br>
      This is my December <br>
      This is all so clear <br>
